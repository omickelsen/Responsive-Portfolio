      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/orie and cassidy sunvalley.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>If I had to use a word to discribe myself I would start off with the word <strong>"Gorilla"</strong>. The reason I choose this word is because when I think of a gorilla, I think of a few things. Majestic, Mighty, Intelligent, Fierce, and Leader. 
        These are many of the characteristics that I contain. I'm 26 years old and I am married to the love of my life Cassidy Mickelsen. She is my better half. I was born and raised in Utah, on a farm. Learned how to be a hardworker from a young age. I graduated from the University of Utah in Economics. Worked as a financial advisor for about a year and a half before I decided to seek my true passion in Web Development. 
        I love my family and friends and I enjoy working with computers and having a great work life balance.</p>

      <p>Personal hobbies that I have are, crossfit, basketball, video games, hunting, fishing, and all outdoor activities. I'm always looking to move up in my career and learn as much as I possibly can.
    </p>

      <p>My love for learning has brought me into a career of web development for the purpose that it is an ever evolving career and you can always learn some new way to make web applications and this is amazing!</p>
